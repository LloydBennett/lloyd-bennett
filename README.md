# Overview

This project uses vanilla JavaScript on the front-end utilising libaries such as [GSAP](https://greensock.com/) and [Locomotive Scroll v.4](https://github.com/locomotivemtl/locomotive-scroll?tab=readme-ov-file), Express.js and Node.js on the back-end. To generate our static files that will be uploaded to the environment, we're using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).
